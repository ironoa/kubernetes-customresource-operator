## About the Operator

An Operator is a method of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application. A Kubernetes application is an application that is both deployed on Kubernetes and managed using the Kubernetes APIs and kubectl tooling. You can think of Operators as the runtime that manages this type of application on Kubernetes.

## About the Operator SDK and Framework

To help make it easier to build Kubernetes applications, Red Hat and the Kubernetes open source community today share the Operator Framework – an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in a more effective, automated, and scalable way. 

The Operator SDK provides the tools to build, test and package Operators. Initially, the SDK facilitates the marriage of an application’s business logic (for example, how to scale, upgrade, or backup) with the Kubernetes API to execute those operations.
